### Arduino simple example

This is a simple example of an arduino app with Adafruit GPS module.
There are 3 buttons and 3 leds, respectively. When the user pushes a button,
the corresponding led, lights up and GPS coordinates are logged (with the
color of the led, too).

### Settings

Output is displayed via serial monitor. In order for the output to be read
properly, settings should be Carriage return (CR) and baud should be 115200.
